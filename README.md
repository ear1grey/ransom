# RANSOM NOTE EXTENSION

Have you over wondered what the world would look like if every website were designed like a 1960s ransom letter?  Well, wonder no more with this free-to-own browser extension.  Hours of fun are literally non-guaranteeable as you look at different websites and experience in vivid reality just what it would be like if each website had been desgined by someone who forgot what they were supposed to be doing, and instead got busy with the scissors and glue.

Built for a hackday.  Thanks to [Port 57 Coworking Studio](https://www.port57.com/) (on Albert Road, Portsmouth) for the use of the premesis for the day.
